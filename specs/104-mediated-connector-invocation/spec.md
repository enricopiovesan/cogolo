# Feature Specification: Mediated Runtime Connector Invocation

**Status**: Approved
**Canonical governing ID**: `104-mediated-connector-invocation`
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Extends**: `039-connector-plugin-architecture`, `098-capability-event-host-abi`, `103-application-connector-binding`
**Input**: #826, #1050, #1052; ADR-0039.

## Purpose

Define the only guest-to-host route for invoking an activated Spec 039 connector
without weakening Traverse's deny-by-default WASM sandbox.

## Requirements

- **FR-001**: The runtime MUST expose a versioned `connector_invoke` host ABI
  with typed, bounded request, response, and error envelopes.
- **FR-002**: The host MUST authorize a call only when the caller declares the
  Spec 039 requirement and an activated application binding resolves it.
- **FR-003**: The host MUST enforce connector scope, placement, path/device/
  network policy, payload and resource limits, cancellation, and output schema.
- **FR-004**: Private configuration, credentials, paths, device identifiers,
  and provider endpoints MUST remain host-owned and inaccessible to guests.
- **FR-005**: The runtime MUST emit deterministic, non-secret trace evidence
  for authorization, selected connector/version, result class, and failure.
- **FR-006**: Undeclared, unbound, unavailable, incompatible, unconfigured,
  unauthorized, bounded-I/O, cancellation, and execution failures MUST return
  stable non-secret errors.
- **FR-007**: Ambient WASI filesystem, network, environment, and device access
  MUST remain denied.

## Acceptance Scenarios

1. An authorized call reaches only its activated compatible binding.
2. Each authorization failure is rejected before connector execution.
3. Oversized/out-of-bounds guest payloads fail without host panic or leakage.
4. Public traces contain no private configuration or credentials.

## Quality Gates

- ABI, authorization, bounds, cancellation, and redaction conformance fixtures pass.
- No guest can bypass declared requirements, bindings, or host policy.
- The spec-alignment gate covers host ABI, runtime, contracts, and ADR-0039.

## Out of Scope

Ambient WASI grants, sidecar bridges, concrete connectors, scheduler/retry, and
generic local-model artifact governance.
